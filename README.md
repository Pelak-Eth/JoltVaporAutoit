This is a project to supplement an existing web based point of sale system https://www.frostpos.com
Without access to this webpage, some of these programs will not function properly or return error messages.
You are free to use any part of these files for any purpose.

This project's main function (Print Labels On Screen FROST.au3) is to parse data from a point of sale website, convert that data into a csv file that is then read by Brother P-Touch Editor and finally used to print dynamic labels on a Dynmo label printer.
This project was needed since the Dynmo label printer has no opensource drivers available for web based integration.
