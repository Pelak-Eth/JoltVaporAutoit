This is a project to supplement an existing web based point of sale system https://www.frostpos.com
Without access to this webpage, some of these programs will not function properly or return error messages.

Print Labels On Screen - FROST.au3 is used to parse data from a point of sale website, convert that data into a csv file that is then read by Brother P-Touch Editor and finally used to print dynamic labels on a Dymo label printer.
This project was needed since the Dynmo label printer has no opensource drivers available for web based integration.

Recipe Lookup - Frost.au3 makes use of AutoIt's GUI functions to create a popup overlay on screen to display ingredients of the current recipe (taken from the Point of Sale Webpage).  This program was originally used with hand written orders, but was adapted to interface with a webpage.
